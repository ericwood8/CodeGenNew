# CodeGenNew

A C# code generator for a developer's own box: point it at a SQL Server database, pick a table, and generate code from **T4 templates** — SQL stored procedures, C# entities, enums, repositories and minimal-API classes, and the Angular TypeScript model, service and screen for the same table. It has a WinUI 3 desktop app (right-click a table in a TreeView) and a scriptable command-line tool, `codegen`, that does the same without the GUI.

It replaces a series of hand-rolled "write lines to a text file with substitutions and smart loops" generators with a real templating engine (T4 via `Mono.TextTemplating`), while staying simple and portable (unpackaged, no installer) and easy to extend: **a new template is just a new `.tt` file** — no code changes.

**CodeGenNew only reads.** It introspects schema (and, for two templates, the table's rows) and writes files to an output folder. It never creates, alters or runs anything in your database and never edits your project — you review the output and copy it in.

See **[Docs/specs.md](Docs/specs.md)** for the full specification: architecture, configuration file formats, the `TableModel`/`ColumnModel` schema, the special-logic column detection, every template's rules, and the CLI.

## What it generates

Fourteen templates ship in `Templates\`. A table's right-click menu (or the CLI's `-T`) offers them grouped by the text before the first underscore.

| Group | Template | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `SP` | `SP_Insert`, `SP_Update`, `SP_Delete`, `SP_Save` | `Table_Insert.sql` … — the classic CRUD stored procedures; `Save` is insert-or-update in one. Audit, active/inactive, soft-delete and date-range columns are handled by rule. |
| `SP` | `SP_Lookup` | ID + display columns of a row and of every table it points to, so a drop-down needs no joins. |
| `SP` | `SP_Clone` | Copies a row into a new one and returns the new key (a grid's "Clone" button). |
| `SP` | `SP_Load` | Reads the table's **rows** and writes a re-runnable procedure that loads the same rows into another database (seed data). |
| `API` | `API_Crud` | `TableApi.cs` — a minimal-API class: get all, get by id, create, update, delete, each over the table's repository. |
| `CS` | `CS_Entity` | `Table.cs` — an EF Core entity: key, foreign keys, navigation properties, attributes. |
| `CS` | `CS_Enum` | `Table.cs` — a C# enum whose members are the **rows** of a small lookup table. |
| `CS` | `CS_Repo` | `TableRepo.cs` — the thin repository class over your shared generic repository. |
| `TS` | `TS_Model` | `models/table.ts` — an Angular interface matching the JSON the API really sends. |
| `TS` | `TS_Service` | `services/table.service.ts` — the `HttpClient` wrapper with the same method names on every table. |
| `TS` | `TS_Component` | Four files in `components/table/` — CSS, HTML, spec and TypeScript for a grid + add/edit form screen. |

Templates carry a version in the file name (`SP_Save_v1.tt`). The menu shows only the newest version of each; older ones stay on disk. Files you customize are never overwritten by an update — the new shipped copy is written beside yours as `<name>.new`.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (the templates are compiled at run time, so a real SDK must be installed — not just the runtime) and a reachable SQL Server. The desktop app also needs Windows 10/11.

```
dotnet build CodeGenNew.slnx
```

**Command line** (the built exe is `CodeGenNew.Cli\bin\Debug\net10.0\codegen.exe`):

```
codegen -S MYSERVER -d MyDatabase -s dbo -t Holiday -T API_Crud.tt -E -o C:\Work\MyApp\Api\Apis
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-S`, `-d`, `-s`, `-t` | server, database, schema (default `dbo`), table |
| `-T` | template file name; without a version (`SP_Save.tt`) means the latest, `SP_Save_v1.tt` pins that version |
| `-E` | Windows authentication (or `-U user` and `-P password`; the password is prompted for if omitted) |
| `-o` | output folder (default: `Output` from `Settings.json`) |

**Desktop app:** run `CodeGenNew.App`, choose *Connect*, expand the database, right-click a table and pick a template. *Output Location* sets the output folder; *Templates* adds, renames, edits and deletes templates.

The first run creates `Templates\`, `Output\` and `SpecialLogicColumns.config` next to the exe from copies embedded in it, so **copying the exe folder is all the deployment there is**.

### Templates that write several files

`TS_Component` writes four files and the `TS_` templates write into sub-folders. A template does that by starting each file with a marker line, `@@@FILE relative/path@@@` (see specs.md §8.2). For these templates point the output folder at the **root of the target project** — for Angular, its `src\app` folder — and the files land in the right places:

```
codegen -S MYSERVER -d MyDatabase -t Holiday -T TS_Component.tt -E -o C:\Work\MyApp\src\app
```

## Using the templates in your own project

The templates were written against the TimeEntry sample project (`TimeEntry.Common`, `TimeEntry.ApiService`, an Angular `TimeEntryUI`). **The names that belong to a project are a block at the very top of each template**, under a banner:

```
// ==========================================================================================
// PROJECT SETTINGS -- the lines to change to use this template in your own project ...
// ==========================================================================================
string apiNamespace = "TimeEntry.ApiService.Apis";
string contextType = "TimeEntryContext";
string[] usings = { };          // namespaces the generated file must "using"
string[] noRepositoryTables = { "ClearanceType", ... };
```

Open the `.tt` file (or the app's *Templates* button → Edit), change those lines, and save; the next generation uses them — there is nothing to rebuild.

| Setting | In | Tells the template |
|---|---|---|
| `apiNamespace`, `entityNamespace`, `enumNamespace`, `repositoryNamespace` | `API_Crud`, `CS_Entity`, `CS_Enum`, `CS_Repo` | the `namespace` the generated file declares |
| `usings` | `API_Crud`, `CS_Entity`, `CS_Repo` | extra `using` lines to write (leave empty if your project uses global usings) |
| `contextType` | `API_Crud`, `CS_Repo` | your `DbContext` class |
| `baseEntity`, `baseNameActiveEntity` | `CS_Entity` | the base classes your entities derive from |
| `modelsFolder`, `servicesFolder`, `componentsFolder`, `apiPrefix` | `TS_*` | where the Angular files go and the API URL prefix |
| `noNavigationTables`, `noRepositoryTables`, `noApiTables`, `noLookupParents` | several | tables that are enums, lookups or have no entity, and so get no navigation property, repository, API or screen |

The templates also assume the shape of the sample project's plumbing: a generic repository with `GetAll`, `GetByIdAsync`, `ExistsAsync` and `DeleteAsync`, and a `BaseApi<T>` that registers routes. Each template's header comment says what it assumes and what it deliberately does **not** write (collection navigations, hand-written business rules, detail grids), so you know what stays yours.

Column-name rules (which column means "created date", "is active", a display name, …) live in `SpecialLogicColumns.config`; edit it to match your naming.

## Tests

```
dotnet test CodeGenNew.Tests\CodeGenNew.Tests.csproj
```

The suite needs **no database**. It covers the file-writing engine (`@@@FILE` splitting, unsafe paths, output naming), template discovery and versioning, the seeder (created / refreshed / kept-customized, and that **every file in `Templates\` is actually shipped**), the literal and display-column helpers, and it runs every shipped template against hand-built tables to check what it writes — the API, entity, enum, repository, model, service and component rules, each template's refusals (composite keys, enum tables), and that changing a project setting changes the output. It takes about a minute, mostly compiling templates.

## Known dependencies

| Dependency | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) | all projects | Target framework, and required at run time to compile templates. |
| [Windows App SDK 2.4.0](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK) (WinUI 3) | `CodeGenNew.App` only | GUI framework, unpackaged (no MSIX); its native runtime is bundled. .NET itself is framework-dependent — see specs.md §3. |
| [CommunityToolkit.Mvvm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Mvvm) 8.4.0 | `CodeGenNew.App` only | MVVM helpers (`[ObservableProperty]`, `[RelayCommand]`), classic backing-field style — see specs.md §9. |
| [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) | `Connections`, `SchemaIntrospection` | SQL Server ADO.NET provider. |
| [Mono.TextTemplating](https://github.com/mono/t4) | `CodeGenNew.TemplateEngine` | In-process T4 engine that runs outside Visual Studio (EF Core uses it for `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold`). |
| [MSTest](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSTest) 4 | `CodeGenNew.Tests` only | Test framework. |
| A reachable SQL Server | runtime | Read-only access is all the tool ever needs. Not bundled. |

CLI argument parsing is hand-rolled rather than pulling in a library, given the small number of flags (specs.md §10).

## Status

v1 is working: the desktop app, the CLI and the fourteen templates were each verified against a real database, and the generated code was compiled (and, for the Angular files, run) in the sample project. Only SQL Server is supported; only tables (not views).
